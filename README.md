# Small-Image-classification-using-CNN
This project focuses on implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for small image classification. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify images into predefined categories. CNNs have proven to be highly effective in image recognition tasks, and this project serves as a practical example of their application.
